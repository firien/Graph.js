##Graph.js

####Infancy
Graph.js is in its infancy, stand by. 


This library is heavily inspired by [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org). Chart.js has a very small footprint, zero dependencies, and a very clean API. What is lacks is the interactivity provided by the DOM (although this may be addressed in the future with [Hit Regions](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#hit-regions))

If you're looking for clean, fast charts, which can be downloaded as raster images then checkout [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org).

###SVG
Graph.js uses `SVG` to render graphs. This allows for highly interactive graphs, but does come with a performance hit.

###Modular
The goal for Graph.js to be very modular. The `Cake` tasks (and dedicated website) should generate code only for the graph types requested.

###Modern Browsers
Graph.js doesn't have any tricks up its sleeve to cater to aging giants
